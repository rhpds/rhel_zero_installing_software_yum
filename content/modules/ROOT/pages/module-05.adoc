If a program is suddenly misbehaving, it could be related to some key
files not being installed properly. `+rpm+` has a validation option
(`+-V+`) which will compare the local files with the expected files for
the package. Remove a file from the Wireshark package to test out this
validation functionality:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
rm -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/wireshark.png
----

Use the `+-V+` option with `+rpm+` to check the file status of
Wireshark.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
rpm -V wireshark
----

[source,text]
----
missing     /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/wireshark.png
----

Now that you have seen there is a missing file, reinstall the Wireshark
package to return it to its proper state:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
dnf -y reinstall wireshark
----

[source,text]
----

Check that *wireshark.png* has been restored:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
ls /usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/

[source,text]

The command `+rpm -V+` is useful for more than just finding missing
files. This command can inform the user if any files have changed since
installation. To test this out, run the validation command on the PAM
package.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
rpm -V pam
----

[source,text]
----
....L....  c /etc/pam.d/fingerprint-auth
....L....  c /etc/pam.d/password-auth
....L....  c /etc/pam.d/postlogin
....L....  c /etc/pam.d/smartcard-auth
....L....  c /etc/pam.d/system-auth
----

This query returns files with unexpected criteria. The first column of this output tells you that both
of these files have an unexpected size, checksum, and timestamp. Both of
these files are configuration files, so it makes sense that they would
be modified after installation to suit the purpose of this particular
system.
